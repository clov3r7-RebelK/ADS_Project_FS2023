Brasserie Louis,"I was in Madrid for the third time in November last year and I had been recommended to visit Ramses on previous occasions but I hadn’t had the chance, so on this trip I made sure that the restaurant was part of my plans. There...were outdoor and indoor seating options. I went for the indoor option closes to the kitchen pass.

The Food:
I ordered a roasted pumpkin soup with truffled ricotta tortelloni and “dukkha” for starters and Monkfish loin “Donostiarra” style with triple cooked chips for the main course. On the face of it, it appears to be a glorified fish and chip supper with and equally glorified pumpkin soup starter(!) 

But before all of that came to the table, I was provided with some nibbles in the form of olives, cheese and corn nuts as well as two small pieces of bread. All gladly received and a nice way to settle into the evening.

On to the dishes. The roasted pumpkin soup was silky smooth and creamy, the truffled ricotta providing a that balance in taste, the tortelloni cooked to perfection and the “dukkha” - which is a herb and spice mix - sprinkled across the soup gave an elevation to the dish. As soups go this was exquisite! I felt I could have had another and another!! The main course of monkish, was brought to the table by a waiter who then proceeded to debone the fish and serve it to me. The fish was juicy and meaty. The portion size was generous. I could not fault the fish at all, morsel after morsel of rich, succulent monkfish was heavenly. This was accompanied by the triple cooked chips, which at first glance I thought was not enough of a portion size, however they were bricks rather than chips! After eating two, I was starting to get very full and I still had half of the fish left. The chips were accompanied with piquillo peppers. One can have the chips “truffled” - but I went for the plain variety. The piquillo peppers were a nice addition and added a chilli fruitiness to the main course.

Having highlighted the pretentiousness of the names of the dishes, The taste and the portions more than lived up to it. I did say I could have had another soup such was the taste, but Im glad I didn’t, because the main course was substantial. The taste of the food was top notch!

Service:
The service was equally excellent. I was greeted by at the entrance and I was asked if I wanted to sit outside (as I had made a reservation for the kitchen area). It wasn’t too cold and the place had a nice buzz outside so I was grateful for the offer, but I opted to sit in side, in relative peace! The deftness of the waiter to carve the fish was very good and somewhat unexpected theatre - I assumed I would just simply be served a plate of fish, and so this was a nice touch. In general the attentiveness of the staff was equally good too and the service was speedy but not rushed!

Cleanliness:
The place was spotless. This is a high end restaurant in Madrid and therefore I had higher expectations than normal and this place certainly lived up to that. 

Ambience:
There was a wonderful buzz outside, the place was in fact heaving! The inside was much more quieter and more peaceful. The only slight criticism I had was that the inside was just a tad too dark and could have done with a little bit more lighting. I also felt that the decor was dark as well and therefore this didn’t help - there was a light within the table which added a sense of opulence to the surroundings but overall the lighting wasn’t enough.

Price:
Make no mistake, this is a high end restaurant with prices to match. The soup cost me €17 and the monkfish €34. The chips cost €6 and if I had them truffled would have set me back €10. The taste of the food and the portions do also make the price easier to digest (pun intended!) but if you after a budget eatery this isnt it!

Overall:
Fantastic restaurant, I would definitely come here again and similar to this being a recommendation for me, I would recommend this place to one and all. The restaurant also updates its menu from time to time therefore if you have been here once, you will feel that there will be more to try. Fantastic place - even with the prices, I would suggest to go and eat here!More",5.0,1

Brasserie Louis,"I had the good fortune to dine here twice. Yes, the prices are steep. ( A tour guide in Lucerne told me that “ cheap “ does not exist in Switzerland. ). The first night I just wanted to have a light meal, so I...sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and quiche Lorraine with salad.  The next night, being in a mood to celebrate because it was the end of my European trip and my Covid test was negative, I returned intending to put on the Ritz. I had lobster bisque and Spaghetti with clams and mussels, an apple pie type dessert, and several glasses of wine.  My bartender and server both nights was Theo, an impressive young gentleman who really put a nice touch at the end of my trip.More",5.0,1
Brasserie Louis,"After having been to three different restaurants on the same street and having received horrible service Brasserie Louis was really a true gem. Were immediately greeted by a smiling lady who said that unfortunately she only had a table at the bar, little did she...not that the option suited my mother and myself perfectly as my mother cannot sit after a spinal injury 5 years ago ! So I grabbed a chair at the bar and my  mother stood next to me and had her plate in the perfect height. 
All the staff was extremely friendly and smiling and the atmosphere between sounded and looked really friendly and good, was a little bit more relaxing than I thought it would be but a really nice warm feeling.
I had the gratinated goat cheese to start with which was so yummie, then followed with the tartare de bæuf which was amazing !! My mother had the entrecote and really liked it. To end with I got the best creme brulee i've ever had, perfectly crunchy at the top and so creamy underneath. My mother had the chocolate cake and thought it was a little to much baked.
Julia our waitress was really nice, took great care of us all with this effortless nice attitude but still remaining professional. 
I had a glass of kir to start with, served in a larger glass than I normally have it but still nice and then a glass of chablis which was perfectly nice.
Thoroughly recommend Brasserie Louis for the atmosphere, good food and decor.More",5.0,1
Brasserie Louis,"‘Twas a Monday night and both of my friend’s recommendations were closed when we stumbled on this local gem. We loved the perfect brasserie atmosphere and we felt completely at home and out of the chill as the evening fell. The two guys who ran...the dining room were extremely welcoming and, over the course of the evening, we marveled at the aplomb with which they ran the dining room. A glass of Deutz Champagne and Louis Latour Chablis later, the onion soup, which Anne said was one of the best she’d ever had, and a warm salad with chanterelles arrived. Beautiful. Anne’s Entrecôte steak came later, smothered in a delicious mustard-scented Bernaise, a d was perfectly done (she likes it really rare). My Veal Cordon Bleu was well made too. The frites that came with both entrees were thin, nicely hot, and thoroughly addictive: an epiphany for this frites lover. Midway through, we swapped plates and our glasses of Latour Santenay and Cotes de Castillon.  We regrettably skipped the tempting desserts but congratulated ourselves  for lucking into a real Zurich find!More",5.0,1
Brasserie Louis,"I don't like leaving negative reviews but I feel I have to now. This place is incredibly EXPENSIVE, even for Swiss standards. The staff is nice, but you feel very much like you're work to them. The food is... Well it's okay. But the money......Yes, Switzerland and especially Zürich are expensive, but 28 CHF (~26 EUR, 30 USD) for a burger and some fries is steep, especially if that burger is average at best. The place is nice, but the price/quality ratio is ridiculous.More",1.0,0
Brasserie Louis,"Strolling around the Niederdorf my eye caught the ""Fine de Claires"" oysters written on the restaurant chalkboard.
